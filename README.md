# Blog-demo
Personal Blog Project while in class at Udacity. 

This blog is a sleek, responsive web project designed with HTML5 and CSS3. The blog features a modern layout with a clean, minimalist aesthetic, optimized for readability and ease of navigation. Utilizing the latest HTML semantic elements, it provides a structured content hierarchy, ensuring that articles, headers, footers, and navigation are both user and search-engine friendly. The CSS styling brings the blog to life with subtle animations, custom fonts, and a color scheme that enhances the user experience while keeping the focus on the content. The responsive design ensures compatibility across various devices and screen sizes, making the blog accessible to a wide audience.

This project showcases the power of HTML and CSS in creating a functional, visually appealing blog platform, demonstrating a solid foundation in front-end web development principles.
